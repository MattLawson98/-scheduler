# Interview Scheduler
The Interview Scheduler is a React based app that allows its users to create and cancel interviews with set interviewers. A user can see availble days to schedule interviews as well as how many open spots a day has! Once a user has chosen the day they want they can schedule an interview during one of the available times that are shown. Once an interview is created a user is still free to edit or cancel the interview! The overall developement was difficult due to my little experiance with react as well as trying to implement cypress using WSL!
